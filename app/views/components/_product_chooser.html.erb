            <h2>Foundation</h2>
            <p>Personally, I prefer BB cream to regular foundation, as I find it to be much more natural-looking. It is a great option if you’re looking for something that has skincare benefits such as moisturizing or priming (some BB creams have primer built in).</p>
            <p>In addition, if you are new to the makeup world, a good BB cream is an even better place to start than foundation, as it feels lighter on the skin, is hard to overdo, and can be applied with your fingers.</p>

            <p>Foundation is probably the hardest part of your makeup routine to get right, as you not only have to consider the type of coverage you want (i.e. sheer/natural, medium, or full), but also your skin type and undertones.</p>
            <p>If you are new to wearing foundation or aren’t sure what type/shade is right for you, I’d highly recommend going to your nearest Sephora, MAC, or department store and have a makeup artist help you pick out one that matches your complexion and fits your coverage needs. It’s also a good idea to request a sample if you want to see how a formula feels on your skin before buying.</p>

            <p>If you have acne, dark circles, or any kind of discoloration, concealer is a must-have.</p>
            <p>Concealers come in full-coverage and sheerer-coverage formulations, and which one you should choose depends on how much you’re trying to cover up.</p>
            <p>When choosing a concealer for acne and/or discoloration, find a shade that is as close as possible to your foundation/BB cream shade for the most natural look.</p>

            <p>Putting on blush can have a huge effect on your overall look, and I personally never leave it out of my makeup routine. Blush is especially necessary if you’re wearing a foundation with more opaque coverage, which can sometimes leave your complexion looking a little bit flat.</p>
            <p>Blush comes in powder, gel, and cream formulations, with powder being the most popular. Recently, though, cream and gel blush have become very popular as well.</p>
